# WupperWWEM
[WupperWWEM](https://wupperwwem.github.io/)  is the 3D web-interface of a city energy model called [UBE-FMI](https://wupperwwem.github.io/wupperwwem_online/wupperwwem_online.html). It is able to estimate **live** (every 10mins) energy and water demand as well as their associated CO2 emissions on the basis of current weather conditions. UBE-FMI is based on the building energy model [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/) and implemented with [Functional Mock-up Interface](https://fmi-standard.org/) to allow for dynamic adjustments of parameters in the building models. The building models have a Level of Detail 2 and were derived by the means of [Screened Poisson surface reconstruction](http://hhoppe.com/proj/screenedpoisson/) in [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net) from a LiDAR point cloud. The 3D web-interface is implemented with [NASA WorldWind](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/).
