# WupperWWEM
[WupperWWEM](https://wupperwwem.github.io/)  is the 3D web-interface of a city energy model called [UBE-FMI](https://wupperwwem.github.io/wupperwwem_online/wupperwwem_online.html) which is able to estimate LIVE (every 10mins) energy and water demand as well as their associated CO2 emissions on the basis of current weather conditions. UBE-FMI is based on the building energy model EnergyPlus and implemented with Functional Mock-up Interface to allow for dynamic adjustments of parameters in the building models. The building models have a Level of Detail 2 and were derived by the means of Screened Poisson surface reconstruction in Meshlab from a LiDAR point cloud. The 3D web-interface is implemented with NASA WorldWind.
